            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>As a web developer, I use my technical skills to design, develop, and maintain websites.
                I work with a range of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web pages that are functional, responsive, and user-friendly. 
                I also work to improve the website's performance and ensure that the website
                is optimized for search engines and follows best practices for web accessibility and user experience.

            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p>As a programmer, problem-solving is a critical aspect of my job. When faced with a bug or issue, my first step is to analyze the code and identify the root cause of the problem. This requires me to use my analytical and critical thinking skills to break down the problem into smaller parts. When making enhancements to improve the performance and functionality of a software application, I use my problem-solving skills to develop a plan of action.</p>
